Caveats:
"1. Population and rates are labeled 'Not Applicable' when location of Death's Occurrence, Autopsy, Place of Death, Weekday or"
"Month are grouped by or limited, due to lack of a valid population. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#NotApplicableRates."
"2. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
"so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#Not Stated."
"3. Connecticut population estimates for 2022 and later years are reported for 9 planning regions as county equivalent areas,"
"instead of the former 8 legacy counties in the Vintage 2022 postcensal series released by the Census Bureau on June 22, 2023,"
"and in the Vintage 2023 postcensal series released by the Census Bureau on June 27, 2024. Populations estimates for the former"
"counties are not available for 2022 and later years. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#Connecticut-2022."
"4. After the creation of the final 2023 dataset, North Carolina updated the cause of death information for over 900 death"
"certificates to include a cause of death code indicating drug overdose (ICD-10 underlying cause-of-death codes: X40-X44,"
"X60-X64, X85, and Y10-Y14). Jurisdictions can continue to update death certificates after the closing of the mortality file. As"
"a result, users should consider that the actual death count for drug overdose deaths for North Carolina in 2023 is over 4,400"
"deaths, with a crude rate of approximately 41.0 per 100,000 population, and an age-adjusted rate of approximately 42.1 per"
"100,000 population. These deaths will not be updated on the final mortality datasets."
